; hi there! i have been working on a frontend for this project i found on github. i have no ownership
; over lifning's python-retro project. i am a fan of what he was attempting to achieve even though
; he seems to have halted work on the project 3 years ago.
; 
; i am new to all this and my code is messy as anything. but i am using this as a learning project
; for my self. i am not sure how far i will be able to take it, but i have really enjoyed the challenge
; so far!
; this project is first aiming to create a functional frontend that will transition seemlessly. this
; is because the original project only utilises cmd commands to open and run the systems.
; thanks for following me and checking out this project! please be sure to check out the original
; code from: https://github.com/lifning/python-retro
